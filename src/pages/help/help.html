  <h1>How to use Red Book Care Planning</h1>

  <h2>With a Subscription</h2>
  <p>With your Red Book Care Planning subscription:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose content from Tina's extensive library</li>
    <li>Care plans are stored securely in the cloud</li>
    <li>Plan on multiple devices</li>
    <li>Care planning you do while offline is synchronized the next time you connect</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Red Book library is your assurance of high quality.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evidence-based</li>
    <li>Regulatory Compliant</li>
    <li>Pragmatic, tuned by real-world experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The library includes starter templates, baseline plans you can incorporate into your own templates, and tailor to your
    patients. These are deliberately extensive to provide alternatives that fit your practice, and to remind of things that
    may be important to your patient. Select the template by condition; it is quick and easy to remove any content not applicable
    to your situation. Then customize.</p>
  <p>Access to the library for writing plans, and access to cloud storage for synching your devices is only available, of
    course, when you are connected to the internet. Care planning you do offline will be sync'd when you connect again.</p>

  <button ion-button (click)="subscribe()">Subscribe Now</button>
  <h2>Without a Subscription</h2>
  <p>You can use Care Planning without a subscription to the Red Book library. Simply select WORK OFFLINE from the welcome
    page. You can still enjoy the thoughtful structure and ease of use, you'll just be providing your own content. Even with
    your own content, creating templates, copying and customizing plans, and using the text or pdf output in your documentation
    (or documentation system) will still save you countless hours, simplify your planning, and improve the quality of your
    documentation.
  </p>

  <h1>Create Care Plans faster with templates</h1>
  <p>Templates provide a quick and easy way to include most-used content in your care plans, while enabling personalization
    to each patient's needs.</p>

  <p>To create templates, follow these steps.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From My Care Plans, choose <span class='hilite'>ADD CARE PLAN</span>. We suggest naming your plan something easy
      to find later, such as CHF Template. You may want to name all your templates so that they appear in the same section
      of My Care Plans, such as "Template <em>condition</em>"</li>
    <li>Add a care topic
      <ion-icon name="medical"></ion-icon>
      <ion-icon name="add"></ion-icon> to the plan. Care topics may be problems, disciplines or just care focus areas. You
      can select from the Red Book, or define your own.
    </li>
    <li>Add or edit outcomes
      <ion-icon name="star"></ion-icon>
      <ion-icon name="add"></ion-icon> associated with the problem. If you've selected a problem from the Red Book, some
      outcomes (and interventions) will have been suggested for you. You may edit or remove suggestions as needed. Of course
      you may also create your own outcome statements. Leave the blanks provided for specifics.
    </li>
    <li>Add or edit interventions
      <ion-icon name="construct"></ion-icon>
      <ion-icon name="add"></ion-icon> associated with the problem. Interventions may also have been suggested by the Red
      Book. Again, you may select additional interventions from Red Book or create your own. Or remove or edit any of the
      interventions. Leave the blanks here too.
    </li>
    <li>When your changes are complete and the template plan is satisfactory, you're all done.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To begin planning for an individual patient, copy a template first. From My Care Plans, choose <span class='hilite'><ion-icon
        name="copy"></ion-icon> Make a Copy of this Plan</span>. Add or remove problems, outcomes, or interventions to meet
    your individual patient's needs. Fill in the blanks to provide necessary specifics.</p>
  <p>Consider making multiple templates to apply to the most common conditions you encounter in your practice.</p>
  <p>You may also choose to make co-morbid or multi-condition templates. To do so, simply add the set of problems, outcomes,
    and interventions that apply to those conditions. For example, you may have a Diabetes-Hypertension Template, or a Cancer-Opiod
    Management Template.</p>

  <h1>Patient Privacy Note</h1>
  <p>As health care professionals, we expect to maintain utmost confidentiality in treating patients' private information.
    In most countries, laws protect patient privacy, and many provide for severe penalties for violating this trust. Red
    Book Care Planning strongly recommends you do not identify care plans with individual patient names, or any other protected
    health information. We suggest using a mnemonic of some kind instead. As the basic idea behind the app is to enable you
    to compose plans to be easily inserted into some other documentation or documentation system, we suggest you identify
    the plan to the specific patient only in the context of a separate, secure system. While care plans stored in the cloud
    are encrypted and secure, we nonetheless feel minimizing exposure is the best approach.</p>

    </span> from the Welcome page, or by selecting <span class='hilite'>SKIP</span> on the Login page.</p>
  <p>On this page, all your care plans are listed. You will normally start out with an empty list, before you create your
    first plan. Listed plans may be templates you've created to be copied (see above,) or plans you've written for individual
    patients (see Patient Privacy note, and terms and conditions.)</p>
  <p>There's a big red <span class='hilite'>ADD CARE PLAN</span> button at the top of the page. Select that button to create
    a new plan, whether you intend to make a template or an individual patient's plan.</p>
  <p>Each plan listed on the page is identified by the name you gave when you created it. Following the name, there is an
    icon
    <ion-icon name="create" class="tool"></ion-icon>. Tap anywhere on the name or
    <ion-icon name="create" class="tool"></ion-icon>, to work with the Care Plan, including changing its name, copying it,

    top. The name is followed by</p>
  <p>Add Care Topic
    <ion-icon name="medical"></ion-icon>
    <ion-icon name="add"></ion-icon>
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>Delete
    <ion-icon name="trash"></ion-icon>
  </p>
  <p>Below the name, care topics are listed. These topics may be aspects of care, physiology, disciplines, or other focus
    areas. This area will be blank initially, as you are creating a new plan. Each care topic has an option to expand
    <ion-icon name="arrow-dropright"></ion-icon> or collapse
    <ion-icon name="arrow-dropdown"></ion-icon> its content, to enable easier navigation. The topics are listed in the order
    they were added to the plan.
  </p>
  <p>When expanded, an additional set of options is shown beneath the topic. These are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name="star"></ion-icon>
      <ion-icon name="add"></ion-icon> Add Outcome
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name="trash"></ion-icon> Delete
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When expanded, outcomes and interventions related to the care topic are listed. Outcomes are listed first, followed by interventions.
    Both outcomes and interventions are listed in the order originally entered. Outcomes may indicate short or long term
    with “ST” or “LT” preceding the outcome text. Interventions may indicate the applicable discipline(s), listed after the
    intervention text. Each is followed by a Delete option
    <ion-icon name="trash"></ion-icon>
  </p>
  <p>At the bottom of the page, there are three additional options:</p>
