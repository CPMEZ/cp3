      Your use of Red Book Care Planning indicates your acceptance of these terms and conditions.
    </h1>
    <p>For as long as you have a subscription: </p>
    <p>You can look up conditions, care topics, outcomes, and interventions from the "red book" master content, which is published in "Handbook of Home Health Standards, 6th Edition," chapter 4, "Hospice."</p>
    <p>You and use the content in composing your own care plans for your individual use, either personally or while providing care in a professional capacity.</p>
    <p>You may not distribute plans, or partial plans, to another provider or providers, for example, to other providers in the agency by whom you are employed.</p>
    <p>This means you may create your own plans but you may not create plans on behalf of another provider.</p>
    <p>If your subscription lapses, you may no longer use any of the Red Book master content for composing any new plans. You may continue to use any plan you've composed previously, though you are still restricted from distributing those plans to others.</p>
    <p> The "Handbook of Home Health Standards" contents are copyrighted, so you may not publish, sell, or otherwise use the content in any way except that specifically allowed above.</p>
