      You must accept these terms and conditions to use Red Book Care Planning.
      
    </h1>
    <p>
       For as long as you have a subscription: You can look up conditions, care topics, outcomes, and interventions from the red
      book [insert real name?] master content, and use any or all of these in composing your own care plans for your individual
      use, either personally or while providing care in a professional capacity. This means you may create your own plans but you
      may not create plans on behalf of another provider. You may not distribute plans, or partial plans, to another provider or
      providers, for example, to other providers in the agency by whom you are employed. If your subscription lapses, you may no
      longer use any of the red book [?] master content for composing any new plans. You may continue to use any plan you've composed
      previously, though you are still restricted from distributing those plans to others. The [red book] contents are copyrighted,
      so you may not publish, sell, or otherwise use the content in any way except that specifically allowed above.
